# -Wireless-Hand-Motion-Controlled-Robotic_
his project showcases the design and development of a 5 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic gripper arm that can be wirelessly controlled using hand motion gestures. It combines mechanical design, embedded systems, and sensor integration to create an innovative and user-friendly robotic system.
 Degrees of Freedom (DOF):
Precise and smooth movement of the robotic arm in multiple axes for complex tasks.
Includes base rotation, shoulder movement, elbow bending, wrist control, and gripper actuation.
Wireless Hand Motion Control:
Real-time control using hand gestures, powered by motion sensors like MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope).
Wireless communication achieved through modules like Bluetooth or RF for untethered operation
Robust Gripper Mechanism:
Capable of picking and placing objects with variable sizes and weights.
Designed for versatile use in industrial automation, education, or DIY robotics.
Customizable and Open-Source:
Fully open-source for hardware design, circuit schematics, and code.
Easy to customize and extend for additional functionality
